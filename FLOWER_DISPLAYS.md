`Legumes` under the genus of `Vicia` were growing near me along with many [commonName: `buttercups`] and 5 or more other vibrant wildflowers. The `Vicia` having beans, I figured had something to do with nitrogen fixation, and combining the flowers like this may have many interesting machine learning applications.
