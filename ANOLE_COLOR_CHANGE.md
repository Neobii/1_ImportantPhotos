# Anole Color Change

I put some of the plants that were growing near me in mason jars to see what kind of `mold` would appear when I stored it in a cool dark place.  One day, I saw an `anole`, a type of lizard that changes colors, and using pine needles nearby, I applied the mold from the mason jars onto the lizard.  I noticed that the `bottom two scales near its tail` turned a `brick red`; it was too quick for me to take a photo of this phenomenon.
