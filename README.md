# Near Natural Quantizations

### Flower Displays
`Legumes` under the genus of `Vicia` were growing near me along with many [commonName: `buttercups`] and 5 or more other vibrant wildflowers. The `Vicia` having beans, I figured had something to do with nitrogen fixation, and combining the flowers like this may have many interesting machine learning applications.

### Anole Color Test
I put some of the plants that were growing near me in mason jars to see what kind of `mold` would appear when I stored it in a cool dark place.  One day, I saw an `anole`, a type of lizard that changes colors, and using pine needles nearby, I applied the mold from the mason jars onto the lizard.  I noticed that the `bottom two scales near its tail` turned a `brick red`; it was too quick for me to take a photo of this phenomenon.
